        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2.5 pounds roma tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped carrots</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon thyme leaves</li>
            <li>4 garlic gloves, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tomatoes cut-side up on the baking sheet, drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 1 hour or until the edges just start to shrivel and the insides are still juicy.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, garlic, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, vegetable broth, vinegar, and thyme leaves and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool slightly and pour the soup into a blender, working in batches if necessary. Blend until smooth. Add the basil and pulse until combined.</li>
            <li>Garnish the soup with basil leaves and serve with crusty bread.</li>
        </ol>
